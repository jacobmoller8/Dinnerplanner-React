## What you need to do

* reimplement the missing views following React practices
* use [Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy) to map different url address (e.g. /search, /dish/ID) to specific components (the startup code already does that for welcome screen and select dish screen)
* implement cookies or localStorage so that the numberOfGuests and menu are persisted on the page reload
